            "- 1 onion, halved\n",
            "- 2 cloves of garlic, crushed\n",

            "2. **Cook the Noodles:**\n",
            "   - Cook the ramen noodles according to the package instructions. Fresh noodles usually take 2-3 minutes, while dried ones take a bit longer.\n",
            "   - Once cooked, drain the noodles and rinse them briefly under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Prepare the Soft-Boiled Eggs:**\n",
            "   - Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Carefully add the eggs and cook for 6-7 minutes.\n",
            "   - Remove the eggs and place them in a bowl of ice water to cool. Once cool, peel and slice them in half.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Assemble the Ramen:**\n",
            "   - Divide the cooked noodles into bowls. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles.\n",
            "   - Arrange your choice of toppings over the noodles. Common choices are sliced green onions, protein like chicken or tofu, soft-boiled egg halves, vegetables, and nori sheets.\n",
            "   - Add any additional seasonings or garnishes like chili oil or sesame seeds, if desired.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Serve:**\n",
            "   - Serve the ramen hot, preferably with chopsticks and a soup spoon. Enjoy the delightful combination of flavors and textures!\n",

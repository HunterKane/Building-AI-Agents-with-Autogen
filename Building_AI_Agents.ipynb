            "\n",
            "4. **Assemble the Ramen:**\n",
            "   - Divide the cooked noodles into bowls. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles.\n",
            "   - Arrange your choice of toppings over the noodles. Common choices are sliced green onions, protein like chicken or tofu, soft-boiled egg halves, vegetables, and nori sheets.\n",
